# Title changes the Title stream info (Go Live notification cannot be
# changed from API). If the special 'default' title is passed it will
# use the output of the `config twitch.title` command. Otherwise, the
# arguments will be combined into a single script and an isosec
# identifier added to the end which is 16 characters plus a space (ex:
# "Title [20210508163250]") Twitch titles have 140 character limit but
# this command limits them to 123 characters since every title will have
# an isosec identifier added to the end which is 16 characters plus
# a space (ex: "Title [20210508163250]")
