# Scripts

Pilfer at your own peril. You'll find a bit of everything, but mostly
just bash and perl. If that's not your thing, don’t waste your time —
especially if you use `zsh-it` for anything.

More substantial commands have their own repos prefixed with [`cmd-`]
derived [`template-bash-command`]. Other commands (like the popular
[`pomo`] tool) are compiled go utilities with repos prefixed with
[`cmdbox-`].

## Installation

Best way to use these scripts is to *read them*, grab them and put them
into your own stuff. ***For personal scripts only***, I've given in and
started using the incredibly inefficient and insecure `/usr/bin/env`
she-bang line convention, which pretty much ensures they will work on most any OS and distro.
