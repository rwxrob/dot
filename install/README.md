# Install Scripts

Here are some installer scripts I've collected and use to build my
workspace images, vms, and such. I often use this as a cheaters way to get common scripts onto Kubernetes nodes and such (in addition to Kubespray, etc.)

Note that I have decided to stream from Mac exclusively these days if for no other reason that the amazing presenter mode. For this reason terminal stuff that is fun is mostly only in my `install/mac` directory (`neo`, `fishies`, `clip`).
