# Personal Dotfiles and Scripts

Pilfer at your own peril. Mention rwxrob.tv if you do. Stop by and chat sometime.

Be aware that most of what is in `scripts` is being (slowly) ported into my [`z` stateful command tree monolith utility](https://github.com/rwxrob/z). I'm even going to bundle my `.vimrc` and `.bashrc` files as embedded so I can setup my environment with a single command, anywhere.

For questions about design decisions and setup consider my [zet notes](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet).
