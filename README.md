# Dotfiles, scripts, and stuff

Pilfer at your own peril. Unlike other projects, I regularly just commit to main with short commit messages (see [`scripts/savedot`](scripts/savedot)), sometimes several times per day. You have been warned.

I've designed this repo to be something I can quickly clone to any system and just run [setup](setup) to get immediately up and running. I prefer this over trying to keep a workspace container constantly current and updated. In fact, it is so fast to just `git pull` that I consider all the other clones read-only and only pull from changes made to this central repo. That way I never have a merge conflict and can use these dotfiles without fear that committing from a system that isn't one I own could give a company full ownership of the entire repo per IP policies (go watch season one of Silicon Valley).
