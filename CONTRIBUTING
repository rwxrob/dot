Contributing to this project in any way legally acknowledges acceptance
by the contributor of the terms outlined in the Developer Certificate of
Origin in the DCO file.

Any merge request, issue posts, commit, or any other content development
on this project legally constitutes signed acceptance of the terms in
the DCO, meaning that any contribution to this project -- in any way --
releases any legal claim on those contributions including copyright,
patents, trademarks, and any other intellectual property rights. It is
the responsibility of all would-be contributors to legally ensure that
they indeed have those rights themselves to release in the first place
(and that those that employ them agree).

Developers sometimes do not realize that at the moment of their
employment they may have signed away their rights to contribute to such
projects without explicit (often written) permission from their
employer. Doing so can result in immediate termination when discovered.
Notwithstanding such violations, in such unfortunate cases, any
contribution remains as a donation and newly acquired intellectual
property of the project owners. This project, it's owners, and other
contributors shall be legally indemnified when unapproved contributions
are made. Any conflict or litigation must only be between the contributor
who violated the terms of their employment and their employer.
